## C# Project

Windows Forms Application where students can view their courses or grades, and teachers could see courses they teach or grade students. It is a personal project in which I experimented with C# and its features for Windows Forms interfaces. It connects to an MSSQL database where the accounts of students/teachers are stored. The UI is done by drag and drop from the toolbox, and I even tried to create my own button object to add a touch of originality to my design.
